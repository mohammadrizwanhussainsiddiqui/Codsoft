       " \"61 ::: Challenging Heaven (2014) ::: In August 1945, at the tail end of WW2, a young GI, a Chinese language expert, is flown over the roof of the world into China. His name is Sidney Rittenberg. Rittenberg is an idealist. On his discharge from the army, he decides to stay on. It's the start of a strange and dangerous adventure. He makes contact with some young Chinese - idealists like himself -- who are working for the revolutionary leader, Mao Zedong and against the military dictatorship of Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek. One of these young revolutionaries is a beautiful girl called Yulin. As Civil War looms, Rittenberg gets more and more deeply committed. American foreign policy is ostensibly to broker a peace between Mao and Chiang. In reality, America is backing Chiang's utterly corrupt regime in the belief that the Generalissimo is bound to win a Civil War. But Mao is also looking West, towards America. Rittenberg becomes directly involved in these secret overtures. He dreams of becoming a bridge between America a new China. But nobody in Washington is really listening. In scenes with General Marshall and President Truman we see how America stumbled yet again into a disastrous foreign policy blunder. Rittenberg treks north, to Mao's base in Yan'an. He meets Mao. Mao gives him a job. He also hooks up again with Yulin. They fall in love. They marry. Civil War erupts. Rittenberg and Yulin are with Mao as he inflicts defeat after defeat on Chiang's forces. America has backed the wrong horse. As Mao's army claims victory and the Generalissimo flees the country, Rittenberg's dream is still alive. He is ordered to Beijing. He believes that this is his moment. It's a cruel deception. After America had ignored Mao's overtures, the Chinese saw no choice but to renew their old alliance with the Russians. On orders from Moscow, Rittenberg is arrested as an American spy. He experiences for himself the dark and deadly side of the movement to which he has pledged his full allegiance: the nightmare of the Chinese Communist penal system. On Stalin's death, in 1953, Rittenberg is released. He stays in China. He stays with Yulin. All this is true. It is historical fact. And Sidney Rittenberg is still going strong, at 93 - a living witness to the revolution that changed the world and that we see, in this movie, for the first time, from a completely fresh perspective.\\n\",\n",

This is an intimate show and the vibe within the venue is a little proper, but they do seem to enjoy themselves. Tim's act is a compilation of pieces from his successful stage shows Dark Side and So Rock, combining spoken stand-up routines with hilariously witty musical numbers on the piano - an instrument on which Tim is clearly more than adept. To my mind, Tim's comedic forte combines the 'rock' aspirations of Tenacious D with the supreme wit and cabaret-style musical flair of Neil Innes' Bonzo Dog Band. He's a fantastic musician, an intelligent, thought-provoking lyricist and a side-splittingly hilarious showman.\\n\",\n",

Off-season, the hotel and the 43-acre Star Island on which it sits is home to one woman - its winter caretaker who braves the colder, darker months of inclement weather by embracing the solitude and finding inspiration, and life, in what would otherwise be considered the \\'bones\\' of winter. Intrepid photographer Alexandra de Steiguer embraces five cold months of solitude year after year on a remote island group miles off the coast of Maine in her role as winter caretaker. Since 1997, Star Island in the Isles of Shoals has had this lone winter resident sharing a very small world with only the seals, seabirds, twenty-nine historic buildings, and a landscape so spare and forbidding that the viewer finds it difficult to believe that nearly twenty years of inspiration could come from such a place. Director Brian Bolster\\'s beautifully filmed documentary echoes - quietly but gorgeously - the still-frame photography of his subject, but also shows us how her richly inspired outlook - looking out from the shores of this small island - has caused her to also look inward in ways most people only aspire to. Philosophical, contemplative, engaging, beautiful and engaging, this short film fits informally into a trilogy of sorts created by Brian Bolster as he shares the lives of people working for extended periods in isolated environments, who have - in their solitude - become not only deeply connected to their \"place\", but who have somehow deepened their connection to the wider world as well.\\n',\n",

This madcap documentary reexamines the Cultural Revolution and restores the once bright reputation of Mao Zedong. \"The Passion of the Mao\" begins by correcting misconceptions about Mao\\'s early years. Unlike the tyrants with whom he is usually compared, Mao was a successful scholar and businessman before he became a rabble-rouser. By the mid1950s, he had unified China, spurred an impressive rate of growth, restructured the education system, and improved living standards. Then he became a Maoist. Mao devoted the rest of his life to eliminating the centralized Soviet bureaucracy he and his colleagues had built. The film takes viewers back to the 1960s. Successful women and men, some now professors at major universities in the West, credit Mao and especially the Cultural Revolution for making them feminists and allowing them access to education. During the Cultural Revolution, Mao brought Western-style ballets and operas, reinterpreted in Chinese form, to China\\'s villages. Peasants chose leaders who represented their true interests, and rural communities built schools independent of the central government. And what about the anti-Maoist beliefs that have sullied the reputation of the man once referred to as \"the sun in the sky?\" They are part of a vast radical conspiracy, the result of propaganda churned out by the same people who turned the tanks on the Tiananmen demonstrators.\\n',\n",

The film is striving for the way of finding perfect harmony for every color through a precisely calculated shape it represented.

Moving Painting film series project has reference to a long track in history of visual arts in exploration of correlation of music and shape animation. Most famous examples include Viking Eggeling, \"Diagonal Symphony\", \"Space Modulator\" by L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy [c 1942]., \"DREITEILIGE FARBSONATINE\" (1923) by Ludwig Hirschfeld-Mack, Oskar Fischinger with his \\'Sound Scrolls\\', Ballet M√©canique (1924) by Fernand L√©ger It was fascinating to invent the ways of illustrating music in film, to animate an image based on parameters of a different media - music.

Tom and Sara Wentworth are the child\\'s foster parents, and Tom calls her Dorothea, meaning \"the gift of God.\" She grows up in sympathy with him, but wholly misunderstood by her foster-mother, who is much displeased at her propensity for caring for all the stray dogs and cats she can find and turning the Wentworth home into a haven for animals. In later years Dr. Grant Hunter falls in love with Dot and she persuades him to give up his work in vivisection. \"Dot\" loves Grant, but his suit is frowned upon by Sarah Wentworth.

Sarah Wentworth welcomes so remarkable a personage as a Marquis, and invites him and his \"sister\" to make her house their home during their stay. They do so, enabling Giovanni the better to betray Wentworth to the miners, and also to make love to Dorothea, whom he makes up his mind to marry. He tells Marcella that he will divide with her the money he receives as a marriage settlement. An intuitive feeling causes Marcella to oppose the match, and \"Dot\" herself joins her foster father in objecting, but Sarah is determined to have a Marquis in the family. The marriage settlement is ready to sign, when \"Dot\" upsets everything by saying that if it costs so much money to get a husband she will remain single.

       " '409 ::: Loops (1973) ::: In the Summer of 1972 I agreed to direct and act in several porno loops. I contacted William Markle, a local New York Cinematographer, and asked him if he had an interest in creating a documentary, in partnership with me, about a day in the life of a pornographer. He jumped at the chance. In 1972 porno was all the rage, and we thought that a documentary, or docudrama about the making of XXX rated films might just be successful at the box office. The actors who participated in the shooting of the loops were: Myself, Harry Reems, Fred Lincoln, Lucy Grantham, Sargeant Tina, and several Gypsies. The footage turned out to be hilarious, but it needed another element in order to hold an audience\\'s interest for feature length. I wrote a story about a film maker, who was making porno on the side, unbeknownst to Mrs. Film maker. We Hired an actress/belly dancer named Cathy Joyce to play my wife, and shot the script I had written. We intercut the new dramatized scenes of the film maker and his wife with the original documentary footage of the making of porno loops, and the result was a feature length docudrama, or docucomedy called \"LOOPS\". In the Fall of 1972 Bill Markle and I began the process of screening our project for potential distributors. Everybody saw it; MGM, Avco Embassy, Columbia, Paramount, Warners. Heady times for a couple of young film makers. In the end none of the majors had the guts to pull the trigger on this kind of project. We came close with Warners, but they finally decided against it. During one of the screenings, Sean Cunningham (Last House On the Left, Friday the Thirteenth)began weeping. He saw \"LOOPS\" as the story of his life, right down to having the same first name as the main character. (Me) So Bill and I sold the picture to Cunningham. The sale figure didn\\'t exactly break the bank, but it was way more than it cost to make so Bill and I were Happy. After some re-shooting and re-editing, Cunningham opened \"LOOPS\" to mixed reviews and pretty negative box office. This movie seems to have completely disappeared from the face of the earth. In the mid Seventies \"LOOPS\" was in the archives of the Lincoln Center Film Society, but since then has fallen through the cracks. Cunningham may, or may not still own the rights to this picture, but to my knowledge, no attempt has been made to release \"LOOPS\" in video or dvd.\\n',\n",

Playfully, abundantly and on occasions, acutely, they explore the contradictions of our Indian society with interesting perspectives, exploring economically developed places alongside backward regions, staunchly nationalistic mind sets side by side with the insurgency prone pockets and the socially conservative elements that co-exist with countless liberal lifestyles, all within the same India. Through smaller stories experienced throughout with the eyes of the two protagonists, Mauktik, who now turns to his own country after a 36-country trip, and Sammy, who has never seen India before. The film creates a mosaic of India that is at once exhilarating, reflective, enchanting and laughable, in a way that has rarely been seen before. No matter what you say about India, the exact opposite is also true. This film captures the contradictions of India in a month-long backpacking trip across three dimensions: social norms, economic development, and a sense of national unity.\\n',\n",

       " '612 ::: \"Trigger Flaws\" (2016) ::: A quintessential California unicorn princess warrior-goddess and her friends meticulously navigate their paths to becoming one with their spiritual selves and even when they are in true mindfulness, sometimes their humanity still gets in the way. The show follows Egypt, a contemporary chic Southern Californian whose relentless search for spiritual and mental enlightenment never ends. With the help of her friends, all of whom can read each other\\'s thoughts (also accompanied by her Shaman, Harry Paul only visible to her), she approaches her goal of perfecting her higher-self with all the vigor one might expect from an artist in the uber-liberal landscape of modern day Los Angeles. However, due to her most human qualities, and comedic sensibilities that invoke the essence of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett type silliness, she sometimes falls short of the perfection that she seeks. And while these failings to attain true oneness and synchronicity with the universe probably make her more complete as an individual and the higher being that she aspires to be, she\\'ll never stop trying to have all of her spiritual ducks in a neat little row. Of course this will never happen, but that is precisely the journey that the audience can laugh at and relate to. Another aspect of Egypt\\'s world, is her love and respect of culture and fashion. Both of which are manifestations of her love for life and her unending quest for beauty in the world, and this becomes abundantly clear when we get to know the people that surround her. Holly, her best friend and co-conspirator in all things ethereal, shares this keen sense of art and fashion which often becomes apparent in their \"shared\" thoughts and jokes. All of her female friends participate in this shared-mind convention that drives the comedy of the show, but Holly\\'s thoughts are most closely related to Egypt\\'s and their similar sensibilities and goals reinforce that throughout the show. Then there\\'s Harvey, a talented musician, and Egypt\\'s best guy friend, who is only more evidence of her love for the arts. It\\'s a purely platonic relationship, and even though it\\'s pretty clear he envisions it as something more, she\\'s very careful to not blur the lines. However, that doesn\\'t mean their situation doesn\\'t pop up every now and then in his or her female friends\\' thoughts and cause awkward moments. All of these elements and more add up to an easy-going, upbeat, new-age, positive energy comedy that not only inspires the viewer, but reminds them that although one may be best served by employing the methods and practices of meditation, and living a healthy metaphysical lifestyle, there\\'s still plenty of room to not take ourselves too seriously, and to lean on our friends when the world doesn\\'t make complete sense.\\n',\n",

A typical American family car for an atypical American family, it provides the women at first with all the familiar comforts. But when their relationship ends, the car becomes the property of one woman and the bane of the other's existence. Even long after their separation, this tangible reminder of their life together--and thousands of its imitators--continues to prowl the streets of the city, haunting the woman who no longer holds the keys either to the car or the other woman's heart. Rules of the Road is also study in theme and variations. In this case, the theme is the standard wagon. The variations are a consequence of experience, which transforms the object and makes us continually invest it with new meanings. This sense of constant change happens during the course of the film just as surely as it happens to us in our daily lives. Through spoken text, popular music and images from the streets of New York, Rules of the Road takes a somewhat whimsical, somewhat caustic look at how our dreams of freedom, pleasure, security, and family are so often symbolized by the automobile.\\n\",\n",

Lilian Broca first became aware of her artistic nature while a young girl growing up in Romania during the 1950\\'s. At the age of 7 her parents enrolled her in art classes. However, the country\\'s communist regime didn\\'t encourage imagination or self-expression and her introduction to drawing and painting was limited. She recalls the day that the drab, grey world of Soviet-shadowed Bucharest was suddenly illuminated by her first glimpse of real art: a brilliant Byzantine icon illuminated by a shaft of golden sunlight in the neighbourhood church. For the first time in her life, Broca was captivated by the radiant splendour of an image. Even without any religious reference, the icon\\'s beauty held her in its thrall. In the words of eminent Romanian art critic Pavel Susara, \"...Lilian Broca does not regard herself as an artist locked in her studio, but as someone who tries to resolve a fundamental problem, someone who tries to find her roots, rebuild her intrinsic coherence and regain her identity.\" Lilian Broca combines a variety of cultural, religious and artistic traditions - Romanian orthodox, Hebrew, Western and North American, thus becoming a symbolic focal point of artistic and inter-civilisational dialogue in our contemporary globalised cultural landscape.\\n',\n",

What is truth, and what is fiction? How does one discern reality from pretense? These are serious questions, but if you\\'re looking for answers ≈ï la Japanese abstraction, German expressionism or Swedish nihilism, keep looking, because The Wedding Video has the answer, \"REAL WORLD\" style. In the first film to come out of the MTV phenomenon, Norman Korpi (the gay guy from \"Real World-New York\") and creative partner Clint Cowen have made a deliciously wicked satire that skewers all the clich√©s and conventions of the reality show. Norm plays \"Norm\" who hires \"Clint\" to film his gay wedding. He invites his best friends - all popular \"Real World\" alums - and has Clint tape them as they arrive for the bachelor party and ceremony. The cast members have great fun parodying the on-air personas that MTV created for them through its editing: San Francisco\\'s Rachel is now the ultimate self-centered bitch, London\\'s Lars has his nose stuck up so high he might die from asphyxiation, and New York\\'s Heather B. becomes a walking-talking hip-hop video. And in the \"true\" manner of such shows, every backstab, every catfight, and every shocking revelation is caught on videotape for our tawdry entertainment. As the reality genre pushes the envelope - and strains credibility - it becomes ripe for parody; who better to do it than the people who created it in the first place?\\n',\n",

The school opened in August 2008 and currently provides a unique education to 30 girls from around the globe, aged 13 yrs - 23yrs. It is a haven for these displaced young women from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Somalia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Burma and Thailand, who have recently entered the US, through the United States Refugee Relocation Program. The multi-cultural environment of GVS offers an alternative to the larger public schools, in which most refugee children are usually placed on arrival to the US, in which they get lost within the system, and will never achieve their full potential. This documentary film, narrated by Matthew Lillard, will be shown on a national and international level to increase understanding of the refugee community and, at the same time, contribute to the sustainability of the school. The film will focus on two specific areas: 1. The community and history of the girls, their unique stories of the homes they were forced to leave, their journeys to the US and their future in the next generation of fully participating US citizens. 2. Raise awareness within the US that these children are not just beyond our borders, but new US citizens who will help build our country's future. We hope that, by working together to create this unique film, the young women of the Global Village School will be a voice for the 35,000 refugee children that are relocated to the US every year.\\n\",\n",

Produced over five years, the documentary chronicles the scene before and after the spotlight that came to town as the White Stripes rose to fame. Starting with the hugely influential band The Gories in the 1980s, the bands of the garage scene are known for two things: an impeccable knowledge of the history of rock and roll and a raucous live show. It Came From Detroit documents the evolution of the scene from underground obscurity to an international trend. As bands such as the White Stripes, The Von Bondies, and the Electric Six started to develop a following overseas, journalists around the world started to hype Detroit as \"The Next Seattle\". We discover how unexpected popularity impacts the musician\\'s lives as more and more bands sign to major labels and tour the world and find out what happens to the small group of friends when not everyone has the same opportunities. Underneath the crumbling shell of Detroit there is a pulse, and a community of passionate musicians that dug back into the roots of rock and roll and made it relevant again.\\n',\n",
